They need to fly *south* and *east*. \n'DAL234, fly heading 120, descend and maintain 9000 feet.' (This sets up a downwind). \n\nStep 3 (Context): DAL234 is heading 120 at 9000 feet, west of the field. \n'DAL234, turn left heading 010, cleared RNAV Y 34R, maintain 8000 until established.' (This is also wrong). \n\nLet's assume the vector in Step 2 was correct for the scenario. \n\nRe-evaluating Step 2: DAL234 is 25NM NW. Heading 080 (east) is a vector *away* from the airport. This is a delaying vector, or a very wide base. Let's assume the user meant 25NM SW (southwest). If 25NM NW, a 080 heading is confusing. \n\nLet's assume 25NM NW is correct. To land 34R: \nStep 2: 'DAL234, fly heading 080, descend and maintain 9000 feet.' (This vectors them N-NE of the airport for a wide left base). \nStep 3 (Context): DAL234 is 15NM NE of the FAF, heading 080 at 9000. \nStep 3 (Prompt): 'DAL234, turn right heading 310, cleared RNAV Y 34R, maintain 8000 until established.' \n\nThis is getting too complex. Let's simplify the scenario. \n\n(Original Step 2): 'DAL234, fly heading 080, descend and maintain 9000 feet.' (Let's assume this is the intended vector, perhaps to cross the final and vector back). \n(Original Step 3): DAL234 is heading 080 at 9000 feet, 12 NM from the FAF (WEBER). Prompt: What is the intercept and clearance instruction? \nIf they are heading 080, 12NM from WEBER (which is on the final), they are *east* of the final. A turn to 010 (north) is *away* from the final. \nThis scenario is broken. \n\nLet's fix it. \nStep 2 Context: DAL234 is descending 11000, 25NM NW. \nStep 2 Prompt: 'DAL234, fly heading 160, descend and maintain 9000 feet.' (This creates a left downwind). \nStep 3 Context: DAL234 is heading 160 at 9000 feet, 12 NM west of the FAF. \nStep 3 Prompt: 'DAL234, turn left heading 010, cleared RNAV Y 34R, maintain 8000 until established.' (This doesn't work. 010 is 30 deg intercept for 340... but they are WEST. They need a *right* turn). \n\nLet's restart this scenario. \nStep 1: DAL234 40NM NW, 16000ft. 'DAL234, descend and maintain 11000 feet, reduce speed 250 knots.' (Correct) \nStep 2: DAL234 25NM NW, 11000ft. 'DAL234, fly heading 080, descend and maintain 9000 feet.' (This vectors them NE, for a left base). \nStep 3: DAL234 15NM NE of FAF, heading 080. 'DAL234, turn right heading 310, cleared RNAV Y Runway 34R approach, maintain 8000 until established.' (This is a 30-deg intercept. This works.) \n\nLet's use this fixed logic. "
